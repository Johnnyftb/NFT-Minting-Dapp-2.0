##### About
This NFT Minting Dapp allows users to mint NFTs and interact with the Ethereum Testnet Blockchain, Rinkeby. Users can connect their wallet, select how many NFTs they want to mint, and recieve knowledge about their transaction status. All NFTs are part of a sample collection made by John himself.

## How it Works

##### Step 1: Connect your Wallet

In the home page, you can connect your wallet via Metamask. The Metamask chrome extension will then appear, in which you can connect your wallet. Make sure you are also on the Rinkeby test network.

##### Step 2: Select the number of NFTs you would like to mint

You can then select the number of NFTs you would like to mint as shown above.

##### Step 3: Initiate the Transaction

To be able to mint, you must first connect your wallet and select the number of NFTs you would like to mint. Once this is done, you can click the "mint" button and a metamask transacion screen will appear. Within this screen, you are shown how much the transaction will cost, as well as the gas price.

##### Step 4: Click 'Confirm' and wait for transaction to process

Once you have clicked 'confirm' on the Metamask transaction screen, a modal will appear with your transaction hash and status.
